DFM project: GDP and Interest Rate
Adding average absolute contributions to the orignial nowcast by @Gene Kindberg-Hanlon. 
Average absolute contributions are insightful because: 
1) Importance of Each Factor: The average absolute contributions help quantify how much each individual factor contributes to the predictive power    of the model for nowcasting GDP or any other outcome variable. Higher contributions imply that the factor is more important for capturing the      variability or movements in the dependent variable.

2) Identification of Key Drivers: By assessing the magnitude of contributions, you can identify which factors are key drivers of the forecasted       variable. This is particularly useful in economic modeling where understanding which indicators (like employment rates, industrial production,     consumer sentiment, etc.) most influence outcomes like GDP is crucial for both policy formulation and economic analysis.

3) Model Calibration and Simplification: If certain factors consistently show very low or negligible contributions, it might indicate that these      factors are not very useful in the model. This information can be used to simplify or recalibrate the model by removing or replacing less          significant factors, thus potentially improving model efficiency and focus.
